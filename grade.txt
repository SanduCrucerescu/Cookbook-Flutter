App is looking really nice, all features ended up being implemented in a 
good way. Strived away from java and did the whole thing in Dart.
Development was farily smooth, progress was looking good in all meetings 
and it was presented in a way that made a lot of sense. Teamwork worked well.

Farily happy with their gitlab management, scrum masters did their jobs. 

Grade: B
